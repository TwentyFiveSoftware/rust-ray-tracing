## Overview

This is my take on [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) book
series.

This project uses the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language to achieve high performance and memory efficiency while providing many benefits such as memory- and thread-safety.

## My Ray Tracing series

I've already implemented Peter Shirley's ray tracing in different languages and environments and compared their performance.
